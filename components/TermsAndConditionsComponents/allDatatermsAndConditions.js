    '\n' +
    'Region two: Medium risk:\n' +

    'Additional measurements.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'In addition, an AI which is overseen by the AML compliance officer will look for any unusual behaviour and report it right away to a employee of SlotsIdol.com.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'According to a risk based few and general experience the human employees will recheck all checks which are done bevor by the AI or other employees and may redo or do additional checks according to the situation.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'In addition, a data Scientist supported by modern, electronic, analytic systems will look for unusual behaviour like: Depositing and withdrawing without longer Betting sessions. Attempts to use a different Bank account to for Deposit and Withdraw, nationality changes, currency changes, behaviour and activity changes as well as checks, if an account is used by it´s original owner.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Also a User has to use the same method for Withdraw as he used for Deposit, for the amount of the initial Deposit to prevent any Money Laundering.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Enterprise-wide risk assessment\n' +
    '\n' +
    'As part of its risk-based approach, SlotsIdol.com has conducted an AML “Enterprise-wide risk assessment” (EWRA) to identify and understand risks specific to SlotsIdol.com its business lines. The AML risk policy is determined after identifying and documenting the risks inherent to its business lines such as the services the website offers. The Users to whom services are offered, transactions performed by these Users, delivery channels used by the bank, the geographic locations of the bank’s operations, customers and transactions and other qualitative and emerging risks.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The identification of AML risk categories is based on SlotsIdol.com understanding of regulatory requirements, regulatory expectations and industry guidance. Additional safety measures are taken to take care of the additional risks the world wide web brings with it.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The EWRA is yearly reassessed.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Ongoing transaction monitoring\n' +
    '\n' +
    'AML-Compliance ensures that an “ongoing transaction monitoring” is conducted to detect transactions which are unusual or suspicious compared to the customer profile.\n' +
    'This transaction monitoring is conducted on two levels:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '1) The first Line of Control:\n' +
    '\n' +
    'SlotsIdol.com works solely with trusted Payment Service Providers whom all have effective AML policies in place as to prevent the large majority of suspicious deposits onto SlotsIdol.com from taking place without proper execution of KYC procedures onto the potential customer.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '2) The second Line of Control:\n' +
    '\n' +
    'SlotsIdol.com makes its network aware so that any contact with the customer or player or authorized representative must give rise to the exercise of due diligence on transactions on the account concerned. In particular these include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Requests for the execution of financial transactions on the account;\n' +
    'Requests in relation to means of payment or services on the account;\n' +
    'Also, the three-step verification with adjusted risk management should provide all necessary information’s about all costumers of SlotsIdol.com at all time.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Also, all transaction must be overseen by employees over watched by the AML compliance officer who is over watched by the general management.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The specific transactions submitted to the customer support manager, possibly through their Compliance Manager must also be subject to due diligence.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Determination of the unusual nature of one or more transactions essentially depends on a subjective assessment, in relation to the knowledge of the customer (KYC), their financial behaviour and the transaction counterparty.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'These checks will be done by an automated System, while an Employee crosschecks them for additional security.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The transactions observed on customer accounts for which it is difficult to gain a proper understanding of the lawful activities and origin of funds must therefore rapidly be considered atypical (as they are not directly justifiable).\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Any SlotsIdol.com staff member must inform the AML division of any atypical transactions which they observe and cannot attribute to a lawful activity or source of income known of the customer.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '3) The third Line of Control:\n' +
    '\n' +
    'As a last line of defence against AML SlotsIdol.com do manually checks on all suspicious and higher risk users in order to fully prevent money laundering.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'If fraud or Money Laundering is found the authorities will be informed.\n' +
    '\n' +

    '\n' +
    'Reports of atypical transactions are analysed within the AML team in accordance with the precise methodology fully described in the internal procedures.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Depending on the result of this examination and on the basis of the information gathered, the AML team:\n' +
    '\n' +
    'will decide whether it is necessary or not to send a report to the FIU, in accordance with the legal obligations provided in the Law of 18 September 2017;\n' +
    'will decide whether or not it is necessary to terminate the business relations with the customer.\n' +
    'Procedures\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The AML rules, including minimum KYC standards will be translated into operational guidance or procedures that are available on the Intranet site of SlotsIdol.com.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Record keeping\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Records of data obtained for the purpose of identification must be kept for at least ten years after the business relationship has ended.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Records of all transaction data must be kept for at least ten years following the carrying-out of the transactions or the end of the business relationship.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'These data will be safely, encrypted stored offline and online.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Training:\n' +

    '\n' +
    'Auditing\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Internal audit regularly establishes missions and reports about AML activities.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Data Security:\n' +
    '\n' +
